## Covariate adjustment example: Continuous adjustment

Since we are talking differences, what might this look like in the continuous case? $\frac{d}{dx}E^{\mathbb{M};do(X:=x)}(Y)$
  * Linear case -- Z in valid adjustment set
  * Nonlinear case: Monte Carlo Sampler.  Recall that. $\frac{d f(x)}{dx} = \lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + \delta) -f(x)}{\delta}$
